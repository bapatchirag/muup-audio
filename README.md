# MuUp Audio player

Play audio using a new script called MuUp, enabling you to type in music, and hear it played from your speakers.

## MuUp

MuUp offers an easy and convenient way to (manually, for now) translate music to a string of text, capable of being analysed by software. By grouping notes in an octave together, it decreases the amount of text to be typed to represent the same piece of music. Read up on MuUp here (link to be added).
